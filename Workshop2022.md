## AnyDSL Workshop 2022

Writing performance-critical software productively is still a challenging task because performance is usually hard to reconcile with genericity.
Genericity makes programmers productive as it allows them to separate their software into components that can be exchanged and reused.
To achieve performance however, it is mandatory to instantiate code with algorithmic variants and parameters that stem from the application domain, and tailor the code towards target architectures.
This often requires pervasive changes to the code that impede genericity.

AnyDSL is a programming framework that allows to write generic high-performance code for modern heterogeneous systems (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs).
It is based on multi-target code generation and leverages partial evaluation to enable genericity.

In this workshop, we give an introduction on how to program high-performance code with AnyDSL and present our latest research on AnyDSL.
In particular, we show how AnyDSL can be used to productively implement high-performance codes from various domains in a generic way map them to different target architectures (e.g. Multi-core CPUs with SIMD units, GPUs, FPGAs) for several applications from the areas of Machine Learning, Denoising for Ray Tracing, and Bioinformatics (DNA Sequence Alignment).
